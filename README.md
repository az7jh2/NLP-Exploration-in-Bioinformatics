# NLP-Exploration-in-Bioinformatics
  An Natural Language Processing (NLP) exploration in Bioinformatic literature in 2016 autumn semester. To try to answer the question "which **gene** associates with which **disease** through which **bioevent**", [Turku Event Extraction System (TEES)] (http://bionlp.utu.fi/eventextractionsoftware.html) was used to extract triples of **_Gene Name_**, **_Disease Name_** and **_Bioevent_**. Then we can search the derived database by any of the genes, diseases or bioevents, and display the search result.

## Bioevents
- Gene_expression 表达
- Regulation (Positive_regulation or Negative_regulation) 调控 (正或负)
- Binding 绑定
- Localization 定位
- Transcription 转录
- Phosphorylation 磷酸化
